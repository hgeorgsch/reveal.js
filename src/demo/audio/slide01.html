  A famous quote from Simon's 
  Sciences of the Artificial from 1996 is this:
</p>
<p>
  The older kind of professional school did not know how to educate
  for professional design at an intellectual level appropriate to
  a university;
  <br>
  the newer kind of school nearly abdicated responsibility
  for training in the core professional skill.
